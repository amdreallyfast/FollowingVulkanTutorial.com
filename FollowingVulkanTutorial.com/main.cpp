/*-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description:
    Startup and tells the program to go. Encases everything in a try-catch-all block to ensure
    that, regardless of what happens, destructors are called that clean up their own resources.

    Note: Also serves as a misc "don't know where to put this yet" when still figuring things out.
    As more stuff is added, I'll figure out how things are working, get an idea of how it *should*
    work, and move the code to an appropriate class.
